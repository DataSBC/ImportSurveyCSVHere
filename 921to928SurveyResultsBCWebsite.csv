3,This survey keeps popping up on my computer screen after I have filled it out. This is my 6th time filling it out to see if stops,,
5,"I stumbled over my password for the account and have often wondered, when we are finished with these types of accounts how do we go about deleting ourselves from the site?",,
3,Site difficult to navigate,,
4,Switching from teacher to parent was not easy. Kept asking me questions when I just anted to do a simple task.,,
3,I NEED MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT HTE RIGHT BOOKS FOR MY SECOND GRADER.,,
1,Your site certainly is not user friendly. Simplify by eliminating 75% of the steps one has to order.  I'm pretty damn computer efficient......yours is one of the more difficult to order goods on,,
1,"I was trying to look up Beth Ferry and some other authors from our book fair but nowhere to be found.  And even in the book fair the books are lacking.  Where are the popular books, the most upcoming, the best of the best authors.  STOP THE DIVERSITY thing. If the book is not good it should not matter.  What about bringing back some of the old classic authors as well.",,
1,I usually get emails when my students place an order on my account and I just had a parent asking me where her order was. I had FIVE orders waiting to be placed that had been sitting there for A WHOLE MONTH that I knew nothing about. This is not okay...,,
1,This website is clunky and very hard to use.,,
4,"My child's school has a Book Fair coming up, I would like to be able to see some of these online options at the fair, however it seems terribly random and usually the Scholastic flyers sent home have limited options.",,
4,"I know this is going to sound super ""boomer"" of me, but it makes me SO SAD that this is a website now and not a book fair with those old metal book cases and all the new books and little trinkets and pencils. I remember getting $10 from my parents every year when the book fair came in and spending every second I could looking at every book and making my choices so carefully and spending every penny I had there. Please bring them back!!",,
1,"I placed a first order of the school year and a student's order as well as a teacher order was delivered incomplete. The representative I had a live chat ""did not know what happened"" and re sent with 7-10 days wait again. This is concerning and may not incline families to place future orders with scholastic book club. Compensation for the student should be considered.",,
3,I am just guessing that shipping to home is no longer an option.,,
5,Love to see the internet option! It's great for procrastinator kids (like father like son!) and being able to get a paperless payment option.,,
5,"I have loved the Scholastic Book Fair since I was a kid and am very happy you have included a donation option for kids in need.  Please continue to provide this program for kids, learning and reading are a right every child should have.  Thank you!",,
5,The ease of the website was very enjoyable. I was able to use the code provided by my child's teacher to look up exactly what I we wanted to purchase!,,
3,"I am not finding appropriate books for a 6th grader on this site. I was looking for the order sheets that might have 5-6 grade books to order.,not 6-8",,
5,Very easy to navigate site.  Loaded info quickly.,,
4,The book we planned to order for us was out of stock.,,
3,could not sign in,,
5,Love the Scholastic site. Easy to find books and know which ones are age/grade appropriate for my child.,,
5,I love your site...It is super easy to use and I always find what I need!,,
2,The site is not user friendly.,,
5,I need to start receiving 65 flyers and while ive updated that information in my profile I dont see where to request it immediately so I can send the October flyer home,,
4,I could not find my younger kid's teacher in the list,,
3,signing in 2X,,
3,Super easy to navigate,,
2,There's a ton of steps to get to things.,,
5,"There needs to be a greater selection of less expensive books available for families and students to choose from in my opinion.  Just  one $2 choice is not enough. The dollar amount to open the ""teacher discount store is too high as well. The class order goal of  $75 is a tough number to get to every month. Thank you for your consideration.",,
1,The parent letter would not download- an error message was popping up.,,
5,I couldn't find the books i was looking for.,,
4,"I had some trouble editing my children my daughter was in my account from preschool and I needed to add my son who just started preschool. For some reason my daughter was listed as being in First Grade and it just wasn't real easy to get them both changed. Additionally, I needed to update my credit card info. I feel like it would be neat if at the start of a new school year the system automatically asked you to update and made it easier to set things up for the new year.",,
5,Great books and service delivery.,,
3,"Website is easy, but a little disappointed in the book choices. It's the same books over and over again. I need some new titles for my classroom library,",,
3,I think it would be really beneficial to have Book Sale events that cater for the parents only.  Think parents night out - host at schools or hotels.  I think it would be a blast!,,
3,easy to manage.,,
1,"I already placed my order weeks ago, and for whatever reason, it didn't submit.",,
3,cant figure out how to look at the ewallet that i created for my daughter. its so frustrating,,
1,I had 25$ worth of  books and the code would not work.  It said expired but it was not expired because it was advertised right on the banner of the page as the code to use.   Just disappointing.,,
3,"I find the site very confusing and I wonder how many parents would have liked to order with a class code, but didn't spend the amount of time that I did figuring it out.   I didn't know what a ""book club"" was or how to shop as a parent - these buttons were not obvious from the site home page.   I searched scholastic and went to the website, and expected that i could shop from that page and find an obvious place to enter the class code.",,
3,After checkout was the first time I saw an offer for a free book with purchase of $25+. I spent more than double that.,,
5,EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE,,
3,I was attempting to use the $10 credit and was unable. I'll try again tomorrow when I'm fresher!,,
4,I wish there were more books at the $1-$3 range. I teach at a Title one school and most of our population can't afford books at the normal price range.,,
2,"I came to the site, but it was the regular site not the book club. After I shopped for books, filled my cart, and was ready to check out, I realized that I could not connect to the classroom. I googled it, and only then did I realize I was on the wrong site. When I came to the book club site, most of the books I had found and wanted to buy were not available. I had to start over. I am spending about 1/3 today of what I planned on because the books I want to get are not available through the book club site (only through regular scholastic site). I am frustrated and disappointed.",,
5,I started my order but did not finish it due to time constraints. I appreciate the ability to save an order to finish it later.,,
5,It was easy to create an account and place order,,
3,It was really hard to put books into the cart from the flyer.,,
3,Missing an item in my order,,
4,"I entered a promo code and chose a free item, but then I was not able to scroll down to the confirm and pay button (on an iPad). After trying unsuccessfully to scroll down, I found that if I rotated the screen to vertical, just the top corner of the confirm and pay button showed, but luckily it was enough to make it work.",,
4,It's confusing that I am being told I get free books but there is no button to click to place that order UNTIL  I go to my final cart/place order. It would be nice if there was a quick message that teachers can place their free order at the end. :),,
3,"The website was great. Easy, efficient.",,
3,"I love getting students books, but it is frustrating that the price went from $1 to $1.50 and now it looks like the cheapest each month in the flyer is $2.    Is there no longer a $1 or $1.50 option besides the book of the week?  Is there a cheaper option in the flyer?",,
3,The code for checkout did not work and let me know it expired.,,
4,It was difficult to find out if my whole order helped to the teacher/classroom or not.,,
2,I don't like that teacher are being charged for orders that are less than $25. I am confused and disappointed that I wasn't able to purchase nonfiction books using my points and gift card. I never understand how to get the deals .,,
4,"needed to ""connect child"" before adding class order - should default to a child in your profile :)",,
4,Last year we were able to ship to our home but this year it is going to the school. Just want to confirm with the teacher if the books will be sent home,,
2,"I don't have long blocks of time. I need to be able to browse, add to cart, come back to it later to keep shopping. But the site makes me start over every time and re-enter teacher's code for every book. It's just cumbersome and unforgiving. Thanks for asking. But each book page is informative.",,
4,Worked with a tech team member regarding bonus point codes missing from my emails.,,
5,"This was super easy and I'm thrilled to be able to help other children, including my son, enjoy the scholastic books that made me so happy when I was a boy.",,
4,It would be great if $1 or $2 book were brought back in each flyer.,,
4,One of the books is low in stock so I could not order it. Very disappointing.,,
2,"I am missing part of my order. I double checked that all the books where on the right names for the kids, but they don't match.",,
5,One of the digital flyers didn't load for viewing.,,
3,"its difficult to just search everything under $5...i dont want to search every flyer, and every grade.. an overall quick search would be really helpful",,
5,I entered the live chat to ask a question. My question was answered very quickly.,,
4,I would like to add books to my cart without having to open the book's page open.,,
2,how do you search what school,,
5,"It is very cool to participate, I remember this when I was a kid now I have a chance to do it for now not only for my kiddo but for his classroom (:",,
5,I was searching for books by Gary Soto. I was so disappointed to have no results.,,
5,"Timed me out, I waited too long.",,
4,Fingers crossed that books are shipped in a timely manner unlike last school year!,,
3,It is NOT easy to use bonus point to purchase books.,,
4,Finding the e-card balance,,
3,"Prices too high.  I have let my classroom parents know I will no longer be sending home flyers, as they can find higher quality books for equal or lower prices via amazon.  Disappointed, as I have always loved sending scholastic book orders home.",,
4,none,,
4,NA,,
2,"Trying to find books appropriate for my son who is in the fifth  grade and  I do  not know what the different ""Reading levels"" are...no idea what books are appropriate.",,
5,Sometimes it lags that could be due to my computer. Everything is very easy to find.,,
4,"It wasn't easy to find all the books that were on the flyer that was sent home. I looked under ""Firefly"" but had to do a  search to find a few of them.",,
3,"All of my information is gone....my order history, my class code, everything.",,
5,Love the free points!!,,
5,With the handouts we received it was easy to plug in the codes and order,,
5,"A book ordered for free that a parent selected, says it's not available now. I am hoping that you send another book in it's place for the parent.",,
4,I wish the online orders from the parents would automatically ship.  Work comes and goes at a fast pace that I forget at times to check and parents are waiting for their order.,,
3,need better tech prizes for book club,,
2,The layout is so confusing. Also confusing to have to re log in so often.,,
1,"The site did not appear to save the books to my shopping cart across devices. I also could not find the wish list. The menu also appear different. Moving items from the wish list to the shopping cart is very clunky. I do like scholastic books. However, the Internet experience needs to be modernized. The paper experience is still just fine.",,
4,site kept buffering  and did not record my update.  I had to log out and return.,,
5,At first I was a little confused on which website to go to. Once I figured that out and guessed where I was suppose to go (teacher). Then everything went very smoothly. Will be ordering more books later good prices. Thank You,,
5,easy site to use,,
4,Can I give bonus points away if I am retiring or no longer a reading teacher,,
1,"I just placed my second class order for this school year.  First order for Aug/Sep  was placed on 9/1 and I submitted my Oct order today.  I was told I cannot have the $10 in free books because I didn't wait until 10/1 to place the order.  I asked if the order could be put back in my cart, so that I could wait until Oct. 1 as the books were to be delivered to my classroom.  I was told,' no' (Debbie) because they were online orders.  I'm not sure why it matters to Scholastic whether I ordered four days too early to get a bonus.  I still bought from the October Flyers.   When I put in the chat that I now understand why my partner teachers no longer order scholastic books citing they said, it's too much trouble,  she responded with 'Have a nice day',  followed by four exclamation marks and  ended the chat.  I've been buying books from you for over 20 years and have never had this happen.  Very disappointed and am not sure I'm going to offer this any more.  Donna Laemmle, St. Margaret Mary",,
5,I appreciate how easy it is to navigate your website. Your customer service representatives are also very friendly and professional to work with.,,
4,Would like to be able to see a summary or narrative of the books. Specifically the ones that are grouped as part of a pack. The ones that are sold in packs just displays a page or two of the book content but does not indicate what the book is about.,,
5,starting my order today - will complete at a later time!,,
5,It would be nice if there for more low cost books for kids.,,
5,When I received my class order there wasn't a receipt so I had to log on to find out who got what book.,,
5,"free book pop up didn't have a scroll bar i used the down arrows on my keyboard.  didn't trip me up too much, could have been confusing for some",,
5,More information on the books would be helpful I had trouble telling appropriate age or reading level .,,
4,"When I searched a specific item code, several items would come up, and sometimes the one I was looking for wasn't even on the list. I had to find them searching for keywords, or i wasn't able to find them at all.",,
4,Wish there was a better system for picking the free book with READS but it still worked,,
5,It is hard to find the e-wallet set up. I had to trial and error search for it,,
3,Site is difficult to find which place you are to order from.,,
4,I was able to get all that I wanted but the site was not super user friendly for quickly finding what I was looking for.,,
5,I wish the option to ship to my home was still available and due dates for the orders were sooner so the Halloween books I ordered today would be here before Halloween.,,
2,I don't like the book options. I don't buy silly books for my kids. I looked up I can read books but didn't find many to choose from or one we didn't already have. The variety of  books is lacking.,,
3,I had to ask how to find where to put the code for my son's teacher and get the correct link for it but no big deal,,
5,The only thing I would like to see is a couple more pages and a little better description for each book.,,
3,I wanted to order without connecting to a teacher.  I wanted to join the book club and order for my neices.,,
5,Navigating the site was very easy.,,
5,I could not find where to pick my $10 worth of free books.,,
5,My computer died but I remember receiving a Green Apple teacher reward with my September order.  Could not search for the since no computer. Live Chat rep was able to find the code for me to use  in a very timely matter,,
3,"After signing in, I wanted to connect to my child's new teacher and couldn't figure out how to add code.",,
4,Could not access teacher rewards,,
5,The site is very easy to use.,,
2,"After over 40 years in education using Scholastic Book orders,  I was told that the bonus items were not available to me because my August order overlapped into September.  It's not about the money, but I am appalled.  Considering how patient teachers have been during the shortages, extreme wait times for orders last year, etc., you would think Scholastic would be bending over backwards to be kind to those who held on and were loyal to them.  Shame on you.",,
4,n/a,,
5,Thank you for adding gift cards as one of the teacher incentives!!  I will be able to purchase science trays from Michael's because of this!,,
4,I still have an unresolved issue from Jan 2022. I received a e-gift card and receipt ($35) and cannot find it even with help from 3 different people and multiple calls to Scholastic. Disappointing for me and the parent who purchased it.,,
3,"Many of my searches failed. It would be nice to see more ""I can read"" Level 2.",,

4,Would like to see free shipping for teachers again.,,
4,Site is easy to navigate.,,
2,difficulty finding contact phone number,,

2,Still waiting for a refund from an order I returned in April.,,
4,"I'm waiting on a kids order, but will be submitting tomorrow.",,
5,I received my order without paperwork so  I had to go to my account to determine who ordered what.  It would be helpful to have the paperwork with the order when I receive the order. Thank you.,,
4,"I will be updating my information, cause I have changed schools.",,
3,So many orders were out of stock- very frustrating,,
4,"Very disappointed how long it took to get books last year, I hope the turn around is much quicker this school year. Kids want their orders quickly and this encourages ordering again.",,
3,I can't find my order that I just placed last week.  I am pretty sure that the wrong books were sent but I can't find the order details to figure it out.,,
3,Easy to use.  I love the book options!,,
5,"I got notification that a student had placed an online order to be confirmed. When I went on my account, there is no order from that student. Should I assume he cancelled it?",,
4,Is there any way to track exactly where my shipment of books is?,,
5,keep up the great work,,
5,I placed an on line order without any problems and am sending in an order by mail too!!,,
3,"One of the books we wanted was limited quantity and I couldn't order it.  I hope they kept it for the kids that would send in their order by paper, since they technically weren't due yet and it was sold out.",,
5,Very easy to search and navigate book options.,,
3,It says I have two accounts but I cannot log into either,,

5,Easy to use,,
4,"I couldn’t figure out how to order books as a parent, not a teacher but I called customer service and the representative kindly and quickly helped me figure it out.",,
4,"I feel like the site is less intuitive than in once was.  Today I was looking to set up a beginning of the year letter using formats I have used in the past.  This has always been easy, but I didn't have any luck today as I could only find brief directions for online ordering.",,
3,It was a little confusing  to get  from the order page to flip through a flyer or change levels of flyer.,,
5,great,,
5,I really love the interactive flyer. It made it so easy to select and verify the books my kids had circled. The free book is a great perk too!,,

4,Thor spent enough money to earn a free five dollar book but I could not figure out how to do it. So Thor did not get his book.,,
3,I would like to know the company's stand on abortion in YT books.  I teach at a Catholic school and have parents concerned and asking for another book company to order from.  I would like to be able to give an answer   Thank you,,
3,need to filter by ar points,,
4,my only request is more cheap books!,,
3,it says that due to order size we earned something or got free books nd I do not know if that is automatic or if I have to go somewhere special to find it. It would be nice if the directions were attached to the notice or if it was clearer if it is attached and I still did not understand.,,
4,The site was a little slow.  I had to wait several minutes before the menus expanded.,,
2,I am disappointed in the selection of $1 books offered these days.,,
5,Very easy to navigate.  Looking forward to getting my son's books!,,
4,"I logged in once and affiliated myself with my son's preschool but then couldn't see a way to affiliate myself specifically with his teacher/class. I logged in again and was already affiliated with the class (I guess I had done that in a past visit to the site) so it was all good, but in my opinion, that process of navigation was not crystal clear.",,
5,It was simple to do.,,
3,"The main challenge is that the flyer aren't so user friendly it would be useful to click on title and be able to see the book (cover/back cover).  We have to toggle between flyer and title to order.  I also wish I could find a way to set my account as a ""club leo"" teacher.  I only get English titles and if I want Spanish (which is what interests me), I have to go through the flyers and print myself.",,
4,some books that were out of stock I didn't know until i put them in the cart.,,
4,I'm only frustrated when Scholastic doesn't offer all of the books I would like to buy.,,
5,Very easy and convenient to find the books my child was looking for. Check out was easy to accomplish.  I could you use my same scholastic login.,,

4,"Received email that said I had student orders in my cart.  I did not, but submitted my last order over a week ago.",,
3,I added money for one child (now I can't see where her money is) and now I can't figure out how to add money for my other child. This is not as user friendly as I hoped it would be.,,
3,"It is frustrating how many sets there are as opposed to individual books. For example, I wanted to purchase ""when you give a mouse a cookie"" but the only way to purchase it was to but a set of ten books so I did not buy it. Would like to see more language diversity, for example books in French and Spanish offered.",,
5,Reviewed students online orders today that have been turned in online by the families online at home.,,
5,We received the book order form through our schools kindergarten class and placed our order easily on the website.,,

3,Hard to find things i need,,
4,"I didn't receive one of the books that was in my class order.  Order # 70304149.  Customer # 79550807.  It was in shipment # 7628295.  The book I didn't receive was Who Was The First Man on Moon, item # 3681.      How do I get this item?    Thanks so much,    Eric Richards",,

4,Simple site to navigate and place orders.,,
3,"I am a teacher (and a parent). I am trying to submit a student order but every time I open the scholastic book clubs page, it automatically opens to my son's page. There is nowhere for me to log out to shop as a teacher.",,
5,"Great site, thank you for having it online for ease of ordering",,
5,easy to order for someone that never did on a computer.,,
3,I have so many e-wallet accounts for my two kids. They have multiple accounts and I wish I can merge them. There is no user friendly way to do so and it confuses me when I want to consolidate their e-wallet and balances.,,
3,There is a lot of information to take in when starting this program. I think a simpler explanation about how the bonus points work would be beneficial to new teacher users. The thing that lead to confusion was that the first time I submitted an order from students in September I got to choose from $10.00 or 5 books reward. The second and third time I sent an order from students in September I got points instead. I also don't know if I should submit the order all at once or as soon as they come to my email.,,
4,"I think it would be good to give an option to schools to not receive the flyers at the beginning of each year.  We only need one of the catalogs and received all of them.  It seems like a waste of paper.  Thanks,",,
5,Everything on the website was easy to navigate. I enjoy browsing the books that are offered.,,
4,"Order Details  ORDER # 69914351 | SUBMITTED ON: 2022-09-06    This order arrived last week, but was missing an item, 36A1, The Unteachables.",,
5,Sorting books by lexile when searching to use points would be helpful.,,
5,Your website is easy to navigate and easy to place orders,,
4,One of the books ordered is out of stock so I need the parent to write a new check.,,
5,Glad to see that Scholastic has speedy service again.,,
5,n/a,,
5,I couldn't find my other child's teacher on the website. She might not have an account set up. I'll have to request that she sets one up so I can order books for him to receive in class too.,,
3,"Overall great experience. I do wish there was a link I could click to see the whole list of my child's teacher's wishlist instead of clicking the horizontal arrow to ""view more""",,
3,hard to navigate and find students,,
5,I like how easy it is for families to order books online. The hard part for me is deciding how to spend my bonus points!,,
5,Want to be sure my card does not cover any of the books unless I put them in.,,
5,"Love how easy it is to place orders once again! Thank you for all the wonderful opps with authors, the Story Monsters magazine, Science handouts and more. I will miss this when I retire  next year.",,
4,I wish there were a digital option for teachers to be able to order monthly flyers on the website instead of calling or emailing the company.,,
5,No difficulties everything runs smoothly.,,
1,I was trying to make a qr code for the October flyer .. But It would not  let me,,
3,I have requested twice that my grade level be changed to 2nd grade and I'm still listed at Kindergarten.,,
3,"The site is not responsive. I’m on an iPad and I had to turn to horizontal view to see things that were off screen in vertical view. Also, the site bounced me to this survey just before placing my order. I almost thought it had been placed until I tabbed back.",,
3,"You have a different site that doesn't show everything.  If I had not looked over the flyer that my child's teacher sent home, I would not have placed an order because I wasn't finding the books I was looking for",,
3,I like that I can order for all of my grandchildren at one time even though they are at different schools.  Like the prices kept reasonable.,,
5,It was easier than I thought it would be.,,
4,The $10 to spend right now never showed up in my check out.,,
5,Was able to order books easily! Thanks!,,
4,I placed one order to Scholastic last year and it never arrived! When I called inquiring about the delay I was told to be patient as all orders were having shipping issues. After waiting two months I called again and was told that  I didn't place an order! I was done!,,
1,Apple iPhone scholastic app is terrible to navigate. Why when I connect a child and teacher do I have to shop to the school?  I’m the grand parent so I want them to come to my house.  You need to have change shipping address options.   Thank you.,,
5,I do wish ny child could bring home book order magazines like I used to lol,,
4,Was not able to choose and use September rewards at checkout time.  I should have earned $10 in books and a book pack for placing a $100 pretax order.,,
4,Google Crashed. I will go back to it.,,
3,"The rewards state that I have earned $10 in free books, but there is not a place to enter the free books like there normally is.",,
5,Well organized and easy to navigate,,
1,"Webpage does work, stays stuck on loading (whole browser windows has like a dark shade over it) on multiple browsers (chrome, safari, firefox, etc)",,
2,"It is overwhelming to use this site and NOT be able to find what one needs.  It feels like the site is full of 'toy books' rather than actual reading books.  It's impossible to order Froggy books by Jonathan London, all of the FLY Guy books by Tedd Arnold, and all of the Magic Tree House books by Mary Pope Osborne.  Why if they are all published by Scholastic is it impossible to order them and not have to resort to Amazon, or ebay?",,
3,"I spent 189.00 total before my donation and taxes, yet i only received one free book selection for my child. I feel that a purchase this big should warrant more than one free b selection from the 5.00 store.",,
4,I was looking for flyers for my class. It is sad but it looks like every time you have fewer books in Spanish.,,
3,"I loved that I was able to choose which book went to which child at the end. I wish it would've said that somewhere on the website - like ""Shopping for more than one student? You can order for all your children in one order"".   I almost went in to do them individually because I wasn't sure.",,
5,I've loved Scholastic books as a child and am glad that my child now gets to experience them. Thank you!,,
5,Thank you! We love Scholastic!,,
4,I need level G-H readers & i cant find any,,
4,The only problem for me was trying to edit my grandson's names. I put them together then realized I could separate them.  At check out I see how I could add a name and it worked out for me. Thanks.,,
4,"I was not able to access searching for books by Lexile through mobile phone, I had to go online using a computer to do so. It would be very helpful to be able to easily search for books  by reading level such as Lexile through mobile phone.",,
1,"Tired to open an account as a grandparent, defaulted to my teacher account and now my educator account is messed up! I now have very upset grandchildren!! Not Happy!",,
2,"My dissatisfaction stems mainly from the fact that ordering books via scholastic.com is very different from ordering from the Scholastic book clubs site. I only realized that I needed to go to the book clubs site is when I tried to figure out how to enter in my child's teacher code. But this was only after I had already shopped, put things in my cart and almost placed the order via scholastic.com (my profile for which was also already linked to our elementary school because I had ordered stuff last year during a book fair). This entire distinction seems unnecessarily confusing.",,
3,love love love book orders for my kids!,,
5,"I have dealt with Scholastic Book Order for over 26 years. I have had NO COMPLAINTS ever.  When I was a beginning teacher and we ordered via phone, your staff was awesome.  As I order online now, you continue to be wonderful!!! Thank you",,
5,Spending bonus points was fun!,,
4,"Couldn't add my free book on my phone, had to use my desktop.",,
3,I am a school library specialist who shops for a grandchild.   I want the child's teacher to receive the rewards of people ordering using the classroom code. This site is not easy to use and I am on book sites everyday for work.,,
3,"Slow, links did not allow me to click immediately, had to wait for the link to become active.  Everything was just very slow or delayed.",,
4,"I would like the option to look at the full details of a book (such as a right-click ""open in new tab"" option) when I am cashing in my free $ to spend at checkout.",,
2,The website is clunky,,
2,"I didn't find the book I wanted and so I tried to use the back button to get back to the teacher's page, and the back button wouldn't work. I had to close it out and go back to the teacher's email and open the link again.",,
4,Redeeming bonus points.,,
3,Navigating to various windows. Slow and browser closed.,,
4,Looks like the site is easier to navigate this school year.,,
5,"No complaints about the website, but as a teacher I wish you would bring back the $1.00 books. I like to give my students a book for Christmas and the end of the year, but it costs too much money to buy everyone a book if it costs more than $1 per student.",,
3,"My child's teacher is not listed under our school.  So I was not able to order, which is very disappointing.",,
3,chat support was able to quickly help me and it ended up being an issue with my computer/browser    I appreciate that your support staff is available late in the evening,,
4,"When offered the $10 to spend at checkout, it would be nice to have photos next to the books as a quick look.",,
3,you need more books,,
4,"The site is fine, it's easy to navigate, sometimes I have to open 2 tabs to browse bonus selections while keeping the main tab open.  My main concern is the timing of Bonus Point and book order incentives.  I am collecting $ from young kids who are used to getting things immediately.  If I waited another week I could take advantage of the bonuses in October, but that would mean the students would have to wait another week.  It would be great if the windows for bonuses were opened longer.",,
5,I hope I did this correctly!,,
4,Sometimes hard to find what I'm looking for,,
5,EASY PEASY JAPANESEY,,
5,Thanks,,
4,Found what I needed easily,,
3,"The ""READS"" code that was provided said that it was no longer active.",,
5,"Im planning on buying some books, I just need to decide which ones I want",,
4,I was trying to find information on placing the order online and mailing a check a parent wrote to you (Scholastic).  I have the envelope and filled it out.  I just want to make sure I'm doing it correctly that's all.  I will call tomorrow the 1-800 number    Thank you,,
3,I don't think I could see my full order history,,
3,"Trying to add free book, can’t click submit because screen won’t scroll down all the way and stay.",,
5,I placed my class order on around 1 am on Sunday morning and when I came home from church another student order came in online.  I hate to see you send another box when her order can just be attached to the first one.  I wish there was a button to attach a new order to one that was made within 24 hours (especially if it was on a weekend).  Just a thought.,,
5,Great to have scholastic back on track with quick ordering and shipping.,,
1,"I expected to be able to receive $5 off using the code READS.  Maybe I didn't see it, but it must not have been an easy entry.     As a former teacher and special education consultant, I would recommend  Scholastic Book Club, but you need to make the $5 off easier for old grandparents.",,
3,Can't find where to order fliers so far,,
4,A little difficult to maneuver.  It would also be extremely helpful if you could show a page from inside each book.  My granddaughter is reading above grade level and it is difficult to determine best books for her.  Thanks!,,
4,AFTER I HAVE  PLACED  ORDER #70517528 I COULD NOT COULD DELETE  ITEMS IN IT.  #6C2 7C2 11C2 AND 27C2,,
5,"You used to send itemized receipts per student order, now everything is jumbled together. It was easier when you had the perforated receipts/order slip that we could double check. My colleagues had a lot of errors with their order due to this and I hope I don't experience the same when my books arrive.",,
4,"I tried to find a book that was in my flyer to use for my free book, and it didn't come up.  Other than that, things were good!",,
5,Great service! My grandson got his books in class and the process was easy.,,
1,this site is very difficult for me to navigate - why I didn't use it last year,,
4,"I WANTED TO VOID AN ITEM AFTER I HAVE PAID, BUT I COULD NOT DELETE ITS,",,
3,"Difficult to understand the bonus points and the free books.  Also, I could not find a link or understand how to process a parent check online    .I would like to provide the information to give you a parent check.",,
5,First time user and was very satisfied with my visit!,,
5,Very easy to use and search for books,,
3,I felt it was difficult initially to figure out where to go to submit the order for my son to be sent to his teacher. I think you could work on helping people navigate your site.,,
4,It was my first teacher/classroom submission so I muddled through. I was able to find all the information necessary to submit successfully.  I just had to navigate a few windows before finding my way to the checkout process. I do wonder why books are priced differently depending on the flyer. I do not believe that is honest or helpful for the user/consumer.,,
5,I appreciate the wide variety that you offer to our young readers!!  Thank you.,,
3,Everything worked well.,,
5,"site great, but don't have a real reason why I would recommend... I presume other parents will know about this the same way I do. Is there a professional/adult scholastic? I guess I'd recommend that.",,
3,I wish you had more books that are a bit more Conservative when it comes to morals and values.,,
5,Everything worked just fine. Thanks!,,
5,I have been a long time customer.  I have always been happy with Scholastic up until last fall.  I am hoping it was a one time incident.  I am hoping we will get our orders timely and accurately going ahead.,,
2,Tax should be included   I don't think as a teacher I should have to pay taxes for my students,,
1,"I have called several times to get this issue fixed and no one can seem to help.  I have been submitting class orders for years and now all of the sudden nothing shows up in my cart when I am notified that one of my students have placed an order. I'm tired of wasting my time explaining myself over and over again, or being put on hold, only to be more and more frustrated each time.",,
3,Navigating from logging in to finding the Book Club site was a little taxing- took around 20 minutes to find. I wish that would have been easier-- too many clicks.,,
4,I find this site very easy to maneuver and discover the things I am looking for.,,
5,wonderful,,
5,I love the opportunity to earn free books!,,
3,"I really feel that if an order is placed at 25 , they should be qualify to be able to choose the 5 free books. Also, it is really tough to spend 75 before the dolar deals open up. Let's get books into kids hands.",,
4,"I'm disappointed that 'this month's rewards' are for 2 months and I'm only able to earn rewards once.  I placed an order in August and another one in September and wasn't able to earn rewards from my September order.   I know I shouldn't complain for not receiving free things, but Scholastic offers such nice rewards and perks, I was a bit disappointed that my September order qualified for nothing.",,
1,"This was an unbelievably unintuitive website and I see plenty of retail websites. It looks nice, but everything took twice as long because the ways every other site handle things like search were hard to find. 2022 aesthetics with 2002 functionality. Love the books and want to support my child’s school, but if I were not committed I would have quit with this website.",,
4,Please make it easier for educators to get to the dollar club,,
4,"I would like for ""Miss"" to be a choice. Better yet, a write-in option would be nice.",,
3,"I don't understand what happened to the cheaper books on your site. Last year, they were $2 if you did the paper form, but only $1.50 if you did it online. (The year before they were only $1)... now they are all $2. It makes me shop Amazon instead.",,
3,"Pamphlet distributed from schools should include the steps to reach the Book Club. I hadn’t visited the site in a few years and could not figure out how to order from the pamphlet. Once I figured out it e]was a Book Club selection from the menu on the right, it was smooth sailing after that!",,
5,"Each year the site gets better and better. Our bigger struggle is not getting the magazines consistently last year. It helps to send them home as the kids get excited about the books and ask for them. Your site is great, user friendly, and love the bonus points for teachrs.",,
3,"It was easy to find my grandson's teacher, just by looking it up on the site.  I didn't have to freak out about remembering her code.       I can also send a link to my older grandson who's school doesn't have Scholastic Book Clubs.",,
5,I was excited to see some really good books that i read when i was little in school. i think i might be more excited to get the books than my child.,,
4,"I am curious as to why the Spanish version of parent letter looks different than the English version for Book Clubs?  I send out both versions to my families and do not like to have them look so distinctly different so translate the English version then cut and paste it onto the ""Our Class Loves To Read"" heading page.  Perhaps Scholastic can do this instead?",,
5,I love Scholastic Book. It is an awesome site to buy books.,,
5,I try to order  fancy Nancy spectacular spectacles book on the site but the book was not on the site but it was on the book listing.,,
4,"I had updated my profile to teach kindergarten last spring, but the link that was produced in my letter to families was for first grade flyers. I was able to fix it.",,
5,"I'm loving scholastic books, and I'm happy that my students are enjoying them too.",,
3,I want to order from your site without needing a book fair code or going thru a teacher. Make it an option so you can pick your school and order what you want without a third party,,
4,"I could not order this time by clicking on the book in the flyer view like I have before.   I also wanted a book that was part of a set, I already have the other books in the set.  I have always found the wanted book by searching, not tonight.",,
3,The online website has always been confusing to me as it doesn't directly link up to the SeeSaw order form .,,
4,It was the first time to see what it would look like to send this out to my student's families.,,
5,Looking for dollar books for the holiday.,,
3,"It would be handy if my customer number was noted in my account information. I realize it is printed on my order form booklet, but I did not have one with me.",,
5,"It was easy to find the books I was looking for. When I looked up a book I wanted, the suggested books were relevant.",,
3,Great site and easy to navigate,,
3,"I am not happy thhat though it says I get $10 in free books, that did not appear on my checkout form.",,
5,"I was trying to figure out how to get the correct order forms shipped to my school.  I was a third grade teacher, but now am in pre-k, and am still receiving the third grade flyers.",,
4,The prices have increased significantly in a short period of time.,,
5,"READS promo code should be applied for every 25.00 spent up to 3  I ordered ALOT and I really felt like there should be other promo codes for orders over 50.00 or over 100.00  It says you can use up to 3 promo codes, however, it would not let me!",,
1,Teacher $1 store:  Teachers should be allowed to use bonus points.,,
5,difficulty getting the pay with bonus points button to work while shopping using the digital catalog book club tabs,,
4,More books on sale due to money coming from teachers,,
1,I’m a grandparent and you don’t have a guest checkout that does not require creating an account.. Not good!,,
3,"Hello, when I placed an order this afternoon, I was not prompted to choose the $10 free books earned or the 5 free book set for the rewards.  I was notified that my order earned rewards, but was never prompted to order.    account # 4016895",,
1,"I work in a Title 1 school. Many of my parents do not have internet access or credit cards to order books, which makes it extra work for me to order. Several of my students gave me money and I am ordering for them. This page will not let me reuse the READS coupon for the free book when I order $25 or more. I used it for one of my students and now it says expired for the next student. I have 4 students to order for and they all want a free book. Please let me know what I can do to get their free books.",,
4,It would be nice to sort by lowest to highest price and to filter by price range.,,
2,"It was not easy to find books to use for my bonus points or free book. I'm disappointed that the lists I created last year, are no longer there. When I 1st stared teaching, I used 3 companies. I quickly dropped the other 2 b/c Scholastic had the best quality selection of good literature. Scholastic publishes a Hello Math series but I've not been able to find it for years to order more titles or replacements. Gail Gibbons has a whole bunch of nonfiction books on a variety of topics. There is another series I've ordered in the past,  I think that is called Let's Read and Find out. It would be nice if  books that Scholastic publishers could be purchased also through the book club or that teachers could use their bonus points to purchase those book. thank you",,
4,"I wish there were more $1 book sets, all the same books for teachers to order for their students.",,
3,The share website feedback button covers the months 11 and 12 when using iPhone and I can’t complete my purchase.,,
4,I wish the teachers had a wish list that I could shop from for the classroom.,,
5,Everything was very easy and I had not problems at all with this order. I love that the class earns points so that I can purchase books for our class library. The freebies are great!!!,,
5,"Very well run site. Straight forward, easy to navigate, and in sync with the paper copy sent home. Really like the ability to search and add books to the cart by item number, it made shopping so much easier.",,
3,"I just think that there should be clearly outlined steps that teachers could follow.  I'was confused about using the dollar spot and thought that I was using my bonus dollars to purchase. Then I realized that wasn't the case and it was too much trouble to go back and correct my error so I just paid $10 for those books and then used by bonus $10 on others. Annoying, and maybe that's why it's so confusing, so tech-challenged teachers like me get stuck paying for things they didn't mean to. I'm only angry with myself, but things like this (being confused) make me not want to purchase because submitting my order takes longer than I think it should and I'm confused the whole time.",,
4,"In the past, when a book was out of stock, it was back-ordered and eventually sent to the school. Today, I entered a book that was out of stock and if the parent hadn't paid with cash I wouldn't have been able to return $$ to her. Are books no longer back-ordered when out of stock?",,
2,I’m trying to select the free book but the website zooms the window and I cant Move or select anything.,,
5,Very easy to navigate,,
4,Great choices,,
5,I’m not sure which books to order. I need to take to her and find out what she wants.,,
4,I thought the site was hard to manage…. Until I found the hard copy sent home from school,,
4,I don't understand why I need to do anything to get the parents' online orders to go through. It takes me a while to remember where to go and I'm always worried about screwing up their order. Why does it need the teacher to confirm the order?,,

5,I did not submit yet as I have to go to school and check on books that I need.,,
4,"Overall, the site is  user friendly.  I was disappointed by the listing of several items as paperback books when I selected them for ordering but found them listed as online only on my actual order.  I deleted these items which I would have ordered otherwise.",,
3,"I didn't do anything because the survey came up right away, before I looked around.  I do plan to buy books.",,
5,Great service! My grandson got his books in class and the process was easy.,,
2,"I was very disappointed last school year when orders were coming in two to three months late and parents were getting upset. I explained to them that there were supply issues. The whole experience left me with a sour taste for using the book club again. I am not sure how this year's student was able to order without any information being sent out by me. I hope that things will get better this year, but I am still unsure of using book club orders again.",,
3,"I think it was difficult to find what I wanted in the search bar. I think the website should have a toolbar that organizes the category and age group. I was looking for audio books and you didn't have many. Overall I think the company is excellent, but if there is a suggestion for improvement that would be it.  I am planning to go back and order.",,

1,"I had initially gone to scholastic.com, not orders.scholastic.com/gyzxzz to shop books and added a bunch to the cart, but the class coupon didn't work, so I tried to just find the books again and re-add them here... but NONE of the books were available, the site couldn't even find them.  I was about to drop $50+ on books, but I can't add a single one to the cart to purchase through the classroom.

5,Just placed an order for Christmas gifts and Halloween books to give out to my childs classmates this year instead of candy.,,
5,"as a first-time visitor, the site was mostly clear and easy to use. my only confusion was the age groupings-- ""4-5 year old"" and ""pre-k/k"" were listed as two different age groups, but i thought 4-5 years old would be the same as pre-k, so those two age ranges seemed overlapping/same to me.",,
3,I was trying to change my address and could not figure out how to.,,
2,Almost impossible to select the confirm bar at the bottom,,
5,Good experience!,,
5,I'm pretty sure I'm missing our second order from last year. The books did take a really long time to arrive at the school.,,
5,Easier than I remember!,,
4,It would be nice to see more information on the status of an order - when it was shipped along with an anticipated delivery date.  An order was placed on 9/12 and as of today 9/23 all I know is that it's on it's way to the school - as it's been for the last 8 days,,

5,It wont let me sign in,,

4,I should be asked to fill this out after I place order,,
5,I appreciate the bonus points and free books.,,

2,I can't understand how to just find my balance. It  doesn't just show the $50.00 I put in.,,
3,"I have been so disappointed with Scholastic over the past 2 years.  Last year I received 2 books that were badly damaged.  Both times I sent an email and I did not receive a response to either of them.  I ended up refunding the money to the students from my own pocket.  I also had a parent who gave me $10 that was sent to Scholastic for my account as a gift.  Although she received notification and her credit card was charged, I never received the money in my account.  After contacting Scholastic 4 different times, I gave up, but have let families know to please not use the gift card feature.",,
5,I will wait to place an order until we have parent orders so they can ship all together.,,
5,Thanks for making it so simple,,
4,"The site works, I just feel the book choices are all very similar and very ""light"". It would be nice to have more not related to pop culture, and additional classics mixed in.",,
4,"The website is really very good, it has improved a lot.  The only thing hard for me is when looking at flyers, I wish the pages could be bigger for easier reading.  Otherwise, the website is very user friendly.",,

1,The order I placed last year still not yet received.  ORDER # 67581273 | SUBMITTED 03/11/2021,,

4,Not showing the price right away,,
3,The flyer I received said pick a free book with an online order of $25+ but I was not prompted to choose a free book. Does the teacher gets to choose a free book for the classroom?,,
4,I'm not sure how long I should wait for my orders to arrive?  Last year there were lots of shipping glitches... What's this year looking like?,,
5,"I like the option of online ordering, and parents seem to enjoy it too.   As with many things lately, I noticed the price of books continues to increase. This cost prevents many of my students from being able to order books.",,
5,"I am finding a lot of dark books on here.  I wish you had more selections that were more conservative in nature.  Too much ghosts, monsters, vampires, and such.",,
4,I dislike how many different shops there are and how the shopping cart doesn't fill from all to one cart. On my phone specifically it was very hard to get to where I need to go. I finally understand the many shops looking at it from a desktop and I guess it works. But I left items in a cart that I don't intend to back to.,,
4,"I tried looking for two books via the ""search"" bar but they were not available on this site but were available at Barnes and Noble. This was the only thing stopping me from giving an overall score of 5  this visit. Thank you!",,
3,0000000,,
4,I like being able to order online and still have the fun of my child getting her books in class from her teacher.,,
3,"It was very difficult to find the ""connect to your teacher"" spot.",,
5,I love Scholastic Book orders. I love that they make books more affordable so that I can purchase more for my two bookworms at home.,,
4,"You are forced to give a ""donation"" which makes it not a donation but a fee to use the site. I don't mind donating but I don't like it forced on me.",,
5,Very excited for our books to arrive!,,
3,"Since i am not at school today, i didn't have flyers handy to look at and had not written down books i was interested in for school.  I had to flip back and forth a couple times to check things and it was somewhat annoying trying to find what i wanted and returning to order.  Also, it seems a lot more books are junky, not as many classic or classy books available.  More sets rather than individual books which raise prices for parents already struggling with inflation, possibly eliminating purchases. I don't find I'm able to recommend as many as we used to.",,
5,NA,,
5,The site was very manageable and easy to navigate. I placed my child's order with ease.,,
5,"Couldn't find my son's main teacher, she referred me to a different teacher at the same grade at school. That may be because of the school not imputing the information. Overall I love scholastic and how excited my son gets when he can pick out a book!",,
3,"Somehow I’m entered as the parent, but I’m the grandmother",,
5,"I wasn't on this site for more than 5 minutes before I received this survey. although I did answer yes on purchasing, it didn't happen yet. My suggestion is to give it about 10-15 minutes.     Thank you",,
5,Shipping is fast this year which we appreciate!,,
3,easy to navigate and add items and checkout.,,
2,"Last year you were too slow.  My continued ordering depends on you, five year olds cannot wait two months and get Fall books in the Winter.",,
4,Excited to get our order of new books!,,
4,lost the items in my cart half way though. not a huge deal but certainly an inconvenience.,,
5,super slick and easy to use! We can't wait to get our books!,,
4,"As a first time visitor to the site, I was a bit confused with the layout of the site.  I wasn't confident categories of books that I could click on weren't ads so I spent a good amount of time looking for things that were right in front of me.  Secondly, where do I learn the difference between Firefly and Early Childhood flyers?  I was looking for a place to learn the purpose of the different categories.",,
3,Unable to sign in. When I click sign in a white screen pops up and I am unable to put in my information to sign in.,,
5,Dollar bookstore was much easier to find with hint at top of page!,,
5,I love the features to directly add a book by item number and also that it was easy to find the flyers for their classes.,,
3,I click on the link in the email (your cart) and it says my cart is empty??????,,
3,I'm seeing more and more toys being featured in the leaflets that are coming home from school.  Or trinkets that come with the books. It's becoming a battle to get my child to just choose the books because naturally they levitate toward the toys.  The leaflet should only feature books and contain less distraction with toys and trinkets.,,
4,I buy to support the teachers.,,
5,It is always a joy to order from Scholastic. I remember as a kid being so excited to bring home the flyer - now my own kids are just as excited!,,
4,I am worried about the shipping.,,
2,"I entered card # wrong 1st time & now its not ""submitting"" order",,
4,I couldn't find an item featured on the flier using the search option until I went to Scholastic Book Clubs -- it's a little confusing.,,
3,Couldn't use item # to enter books,,
5,thanks for having great options at great price points,,
5,not sure how to connect to a new teacher for the new school year,,
4,"I wish it were possible to select the format type (e.g., ""interactive board book"") from a book's detail page and go to a filtered page of books of that type. I'm sure I could filter to it from the broader book search page but it would be nice to get there from a book page, too.",,
5,"easy to connect to teachers, even without a code!",,
5,N/A,,
3,"I'd like to offer 2 suggestions for the Book Club.    I am never aware that a parent has placed an order.  I do not receive an email notifying me,  which I think would be helpful.  The only way I know if there's an order is if I log in to my account and check that.    One of my parents sent me an email asking about her daughter's order and why she keeps getting emails from Scholastic about it.  I had no idea the parent had even submitted an order.    Secondly,  I think  Scholastic should set teacher accounts to a ""holding"" position  at the end of each school year. (no parent can place an order).  The teacher, at the start of the school year, or whenever he/she chooses, ""opens"" her account to her class for ordering.   The teacher then can check the account more regularly knowing that parents may be placing orders.    These are some suggestions I think would be helpful.  Thank you.",,
3,I wish once I've submitted payment and completed my order there would have been a pop-up or model that says your order is completed. Felt a little bit unnerving because I wasn't sure if my order actually went through. Maybe I'm just crazy but that's how I felt.,,
2,I can’t order my free $10,,
3,"This site is incredibly difficult to manipulate.  I have problems  finding where to submit bonus point orders as well as the ""$10"" to SPEND RIGHT NOW.",,
4,I changed grade levels and need a place to request paper copies of order forms.  I need them to be sent to me again.,,
5,Encouraging reading is very important,,
4,I had been a teacher in this district so had an account already.   It took awhile for me to figure out how to change my information to parent instead.  There was one point where it wouldn't let me edit but then after a few attempts it worked.,,
4,Finding things can be a bit difficult as the pages are very busy.,,
4,I don't feel like it is as easy to navigate the teacher selections as I would like.  I always have to hunt for the packets that I want to buy for holiday gifts.  I wish there was just an easily formatted teacher page.  Maybe I'm doing it wrong though.,,
3,Love the books offered,,
1,My computer says promotions at the top READS $5 and when put in it says that promo has expired.,,
4,I am hoping that this year is much better with scholastic.  There were so many issues last year that I stopped sending flyers home because it was such a bad experience for my families that did order,,
4,"I switched sites this year and although I did change my profile information, I have not yet received catalogs.",,
3,"I think the books and activity kits are a little pricey but other than that, had a fine experience.",,
4,"On my flyer it says ""Pick a free book up to $5 with and online order of $25"", and my order is $49 and there is no  promo showing up.",,
5,I really like scholastic book clubs!!  It is so nice that teachers are given points and materials in return for the hard work they do.  Sending out the book orders and making order due dates are definitely worth the time taken to do that.,,
5,"This site was quite easy to navigate through, which I very truly appreciated.  For this reason, shopping  was not just convenient, but an actual enjoyable experience.  I look forward to revisiting this site, to purchase more books in the near future.",,
2,I’m very unhappy that I almost ordered a book from The FIRST GRADE flyer that uses they them pronouns!!   Wish I could order books without having to worry about woke nonsense.,,
5,SUPER easy to use! I love the feature at the top where I can just type in the item number. Made the whole thing a breeze!,,
5,very good,,
3,"I am pleased with some things, but disappointed in others.  A few years ago I was able to receive two 10,000 point bonuses in September because I had over $600 worth of orders.  This year I got my students all excited because we also ended up with over $600 worth of orders, but it didn't work that way.  Now I have to tell them that even though we got all those orders, we only got the bonus once, so that will limit our choices for our classroom library this year. Also, the $1 bookstore is pretty much pointless for middle school teachers.  There are hardly any relevant choices anywhere near our students' interest or reading levels. I bought two, and I'm questioning whether the $2 was even worth it for them.",,
3,HARD TO FIND PLACE TO CONNECT TO TEACHER.  ALSO WANTED TO SEND IT TO MY HOUSE BUT COULDN'T FIND AN OPTION FOR THAT.,,
3,Wouldn't let me put granddaughters birth month in.  Couldn't see month of Dec.,,
5,Awesome website,,
3,"I would love to see more Under 5 or $10 items through Scholastic Club. Also, there are not as many Non-fictions Science books hat's being sold. So that it is affordable for many.",,
3,I couldn't find a spot to order the paper copies of the flyers.,,
4,"I tried to do the order on Google Chrome, but the promo code would not work. Once I logged in using the Safari browser, it worked fine.",,
3,"Site is fairly easy to navigate, so all went well!",,
2,I didn't like that I had to make an account when I was originally only looking.  I was unable to enter the number from the flyer only the title.,,
5,SITE WAS EASY TO NAVIGATE,,
2,I have tried twice to sign up and I get to the end. it says go back to site button then it says it doesn't recognize my email. So my account was not made.,,
5,easy to order,,
3,"Not able to change ship to.  Do not want child to know about books.  My valid credit card would not be taken.  Difficulty moving around website, not able to find way to things.",,
5,I had a hard time figuring out how to enter the code for my free book The example is not how you get to the next page.,,
4,I wanted to get a book that would catch my niece's attention and that she would enjoy. It was easy to look for a book. Might order more in the future.,,
4,Can’t see the dollar deals even though my class surpassed the $75 mark.,,
3,Couldn’t click the submit & apply for the free book,,
4,It was not super easy to navigate which was disappointing!,,
1,"I want to order a book for my daughter that is not offered in the selections offered with her class code.  If I look on the scholastic website without the class code, I can find the book.  Why can't I order any book from your site and have it applied to her class code?  And why can't it be delivered to her school?",,
5,Great!,,
3,Wish it was easier/more intuitive to browse for other books my daughter might like.,,
4,Can't find a logout button/area.,,
3,I want to be able to see more books at one time on one page. Like I enter a keyword or grade level and a whole page of 48-72 results come up.,,
5,Jared was very helpful and got the issue taken care of very quickly.,,
4,I was looking for the teacher wishlist but found it difficult to locate and was only able to see one book.,,
4,I found out that a book that a parent ordered from this month's flyer is not available for purchase. I cannot order the books until I speak to the parent.,,
5,It was great!,,
4,"Once you submit an order for the month, if you forget something, I wish you didn't get charged for shipping.",,
5,Great site!,,
4,Adding a teacher/classroom to an existing account is not very intuitive. I would not have known that I even needed to add it if I hadn't gotten a code from the teacher so I had to search around where to put the code in. Other less internet savvy parents may miss getting the code entered.,,
5,Made me do this before I was done kinda weird maybe wait to pop up til we have actually ordered,,
5,The website is great!  We would love it if the first books in each series (Dragon Girls Diary of a Pug) were offered as single units and not just in packs!,,
5,"I am just concerned that the order is expected by 7:00 pm tomorrow, and we are a school.",,
5,I could not find my son's school or teacher at first. But I was able to find his school and one of the teachers associated with the program.,,
4,Thank you.,,
4,When am I able to get the book I order if I order one!,,
3,it needs an easier front page - felt lost when I entered thought I am not a teacher???,,
3,It takes a LONG time for my payment to clear.,,
5,I did the book fairs as a kid and love to read even now as an adult. I think it is awesome that the scholastic book club still remains a thing so I can instill a love for reading in my children!,,
4,"I entered the parent's email addresses, but I could not send the emails.  Also, I was looking for the book, Clifford's Puppy Days Apple-Picking Day and could not find it.  Just gave up and had what has been ordered to date sent to us.",,
5,Love y'all,,
3,"Wish I could somehow indicate which book (already in my shopping cart) that I want to use the READS promo for, instead of needing to search for the book on a separate list.  The first time I used the promo years ago, I ended up accidentally ordering 2 copies of the book because I'd added it to my shopping cart and then looked it up as the free book.",,
3,Grandparent,,
2,I don't have a computer and you are making it hard to buy books for my daughter and you need to not make this the first 2 weeks o of school how can those parents pay for this pay for the pictures and sell candy we are not rich so therefore if you made it more in the school year we could probably do more so please consider that thank you have a nice day,,
4,just looking and adding books to my cart to buy at a different time.,,
3,"Setting up my account, your email field automatically capitalizes the first letter. I tried to edit, but couldn’t reach that field again.",,
5,I even had an order from a former student's Aunt that remembered that I have the book orders available to the families,,
1,How do I order HARD COPIES of flyers? This should be front and center on any flyer page.,,
5,My daughter really enjoys the books from scholastic. She is in 3rd grade and loves to explore different types of books.,,
5,I love Scholastic. I work at a developmental preschool and they were not using book orders so I signed us up and take care of all of the classrooms orders so that parents can order decently priced books and instill the love of reading before school starts.,,
3,It is a bit difficult to navigate this site.  I couldn't find where to fill out the wallet for BOTH kids.  It took me forever and was super frustrating.  There needs to be an easy to find option to fill your children's ewallet for a book fair.,,
3,Can’t tell if took order or not? My PayPal got charged.,,
4,The site is user friendly. Thanks!,,
5,Love this website. Love books! Love the new material each time I visit!,,
2,Site did not alert me to a student order until a month later.,,
5,I would love to see the dollar store open year around and not just when my order qualifies,,
4,Would like to easily see which books are in the pack and what the cost is.  It shouldn't matter who my child's teacher is.,,
3,Said I was eligible for a free book with a 25$ order but no where did I get prompted to order the free book,,
3,I cant easily click  on the choices for searching for the right books for my son!,,
5,VERY easy to use website. Thanks!,,
3,I would really LOVE to be able to see one page of the book to make sure my child would be interested.,,
4,I like to see that there are some $1 books available again.,,
5,I had an order delivered today. Two of a students books had covers that were very bent up. There is nothing so nice as a brand new book. It is a bit sad to have a brand new book that looks like it has already had a tough life.  It seems like it would be an easy fix to stuff boxes with crinkled up paper of some sort to prevent this from happening.,,
4,"I really wish there was a way to look up the books by price. I love to get extra books to have stashed away for random things but it's so difficult to find the ones you have on ""sale"" unless i go flyer by flyer",,
1,"Hello,    I'm very disappointed with the lack of support I received from the Live Chat feature.   I submitted an online order yesterday (9/21) for over $25 and am having the students' books shipped to the school.  Another student brought in a check today for another order.  It was submitted after the due date however, no teacher is going to turn away a student that wants to order books.    The late order was for one item that costs $15.00. I was told that I couldn't add the item to previous order.  I understand that, but I was really disappointed when told that the shipping charge couldn't be waived in this case.       I don't believe the parent should have to pay more, and I certainly don't want to pay out of my pocket.  I would assume that Scholastic would be a little more accommodating, especially  early in the school year.     Thanks for your time,  John Farley",,
5,It was fabulous. I was helped immediately without question. I had very little time and it was so quick! Thank you!,,
5,I am looking forward to getting my families involved in purchasing books!,,
5,"Very easy to use, intuitive.",,
5,"I was concerned that it would be difficult to change my school/contact info, but it was VERY easy!  Thanks!",,
3,Pre k child likes interactive books.  I couldn’t find on the website.,,
3,"The site is terribly difficult to navigate. It changes from my childs class group to a teacher site. I add to my cart, then need to create an account to view it. Then add my childs info. have to REDO it all to check out. Then it asks me to log back in and your cart disappears. Who in their right mind can possibly successfully check out on your site? Why is it purposely made to be confusing? I bet more parents would support these sales if you had a site that was functional. Find help.",,
5,I love how easy the website is to use!,,
5,I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to adapt to the feedback from educators. I know last year was tough but your ability to recognize that and bounce back with changes made has been a truly admirable thing. Thank you!,,
5,"Easy to use, love that teacher's get points for more books and kids get great books in their fingertips at home!",,
4,When the flyer pops up it's a little aggravating to navigate. Cannot zoom in or scroll easily and the page does not fit well on the screen.,,
1,"Please do not even offer filtering categories for books if you do not have the appropriate metadata attributed to each book.  For example, filtering on ""Grade Interest""  ""Kindergarten"" and ""Paperback Book Pack"", there are 141 results in the search.  If I then try to refine my search by Genre there are only 83 potential values listed there.  In other words (141 - 83  58) 58 of these books do not have a Genre attached to them from a metadata perspective and are therefore never displayed to users who choose to utilize Genre as a filter.",,
5,The shipping definitely needs to be quicker.,,
2,I have been waiting almost 1 month since I placed my order to yet receive my child’s books.,,
3,Hard to understand how to order books from the flyer and to know where to place the teachers school code - I eventually found it but it was not obvious.  Perhaps a pop-up alerting people how that process works - ???,,
1,"If you are going to offer for parents to write checks, there needs to be some kind of option for books that are out of stock.  I spent over 20 minutes on the phone last week with Scholastic trying to find an option that did not have me contacting the parent about an out of stock item.  In the past, you have sent another book and a voucher for choosing a different book on their next order.  This should not be more work for teachers.  I have enough to do without contacting parents about out of stock books.  I was very frustrated and put on hold at least 2x so they could tell me that there was nothing they could do.  In the end, I had to contact the parents anyway, as there was nothing she could do, except offer me free shipping.  Thank you, but my order already qualified for free shipping.  Not helpful and a useless ""gift"" for me putting in all the extra time that was necessary for this order.",,
2,"It said there are special offers because of the amount of my student's orders, but the links are unclickable and I'm unable to find how to access those offers ($10 off, etc).",,
3,My child's teacher says they cannot see my order but my order looks like it is submitted and ready on my end.,,
5,Wonderful customer service on the chat!,,
2,Difficult to change class code from last year's class as I want to give this year's teacher credit.,,
5,"Sometimes I get boxes that are missing books, but I always get help and get it ordered right away.",,
5,The site was easy to navigate and I enjoyed looking at the recommendations that came with the book selections.,,
2,I was hoping to find a wider range of books. I ended up placing an order on the main Scholastic site.,,
2,"I tried to place an order over $25 and use the code READS to get a free book. It was advertised all over, on the site, on the flyers and the teacher also gave us the code to use. However, when I tried to apply it, it kept saying it was expired. I did not end up placing an order.",,
5,Is there a search for $2 books?,,
4,"This is my first order this year, if it gets here in a timely fashion I will continue to order. I had to quit last year because I never knew when my order would get here and they never came in a complete manor.",,
5,we love scholastic!,,
2,"some book series don't list all the book pictures or names, so I don't know if I will get duplicated orders.",,
4,"I was reviewing my order.  I will submit order tomorrow, as that is our deadline.",,
5,I am so excited that my babies now get to experience the amazingness that is Scholastic Books! You have a great selection and wonderful prices. Books shouldn't be a luxury item and you are helping to put books in kids' hands. Thank you!,,
4,I am disappointed  that there are no longer the 10 for $10 book packs.,,
5,"I am happy that Scholastic was able to catch up with the demand after the Covid mess, it was very difficult to see kids hopeful faces when their orders were so delayed.",,
5,Very user friendly!,,
5,I can't find my child's teacher,,
5,"I love Scholastic! I make a big deal every year about how easy, inexpensive it is to build your home library with scholastic books!",,
4,"Good pricing, I don't even mind that the books have been made with the absolute minimum cost in mind, the kids love them anyway.  The $2-10 price range allows  children the joy of receiving a book with their friends, and this kind of experience sparks a life long passion for reading!  Thank you Scholastic",,
4,I noticed some price differences in the same books. For instance the book If you give a Mouse a cookie it's $5. In the flyer it is  $2. You can get it for $2 if you can figure out how to click on the flyer. Just seems a bit off.,,
5,I like the site,,
4,We did not have a great experience last year compared to the years before with the receipt of our orders. Hoping the kinks were worked out. I love sending forms home so they can be ordered.,,
5,It went very smoothly and quickly.,,
5,Yahoo!! Our book order came lightning-fast this year! The glitches look like they've been worked out. Kudos!!!,,
1,Can't click on see details becaue content covers,,
4,Having ALOT of difficulty with the new Scholastic Digital Manager site to access my Storyworks3 and Scholastic News3 subscriptions.,,
5,this is our first order and it was so easy to place it and the order goes straight to her teacher which i love.,,
2,"It was confusing while looking for books to know whether I was still connected to the class page, so it would get credit for my purchases. It was NOT until after I had to create a login that I knew I was still connected to the right teacher's site. Also, I don't know why I had to create a login to make a purchase. I won't likely be using the site again.  On a different day, I selected several items, but I couldn't look at the cart to double-check what I'd put in there. As I went from section to section in the catalog, I lost track of which books or games I added to the cart. I gave up and tried again two days later.  The experience that day was so frustrating, I almost said forget about it and not place an order.",,
4,"In the section for selecting books with the additional dollars given for large orders, book titles do not expand once in the selected list. You must re-search the titles to have a title to click on and have the summary and book cover pop up.",,
5,"Why wouldn't it let me put early early childhood at the beginning when it ask the child""s grade..I had to put preschool when he is only two.",,
3,"I get the bundles, but I should be able to purchase the single book if the bundle already has several of the books we already have.",,
4,I could not find a way to find books by reviews. Having that sorting option would have been good to have.,,
3,"I couldn't find out how to use points and get classroom books.  I'll try again in the future.  it  is my first time as director for our preschool, going online to approve orders.   I didn't think it was all that helpful.",,
